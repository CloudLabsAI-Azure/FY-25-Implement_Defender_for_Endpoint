# Day 01 & 02: Streamline Management and Safegaurd endpoints

### Overall Estimated Duration: 72 Hours

## Overview

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is an advanced security solution designed to help organizations safeguard their endpoints, including desktops, laptops, and servers, against sophisticated cyber threats. Previously named Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), this service is part of the Microsoft Defender suite and offers powerful features such as endpoint detection and response (EDR), threat intelligence, and vulnerability management. 

## Objective

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- **Setting up the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Environment** : This hands-on exercise aims to implement and manage Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, strengthening endpoint security and aligning security policies with organizational standards.

- **Endpoint Onboarding - Conducting a PowerShell Detection Test with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** : This hands-on exercise aims to onboard Windows Server devices to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, verified device compliance with security policies, and conducted detection tests to confirm threat response capabilities, gaining hands-on experience in device onboarding, policy enforcement, and endpoint threat detection. 

- **Endpoint Security and Attack Detection using Defender for Endpoint** : This hands-on exercise participants gained hands-on experience in simulating and investigating Drive-by URL attacks, enhancing their understanding of attack techniques and improving their organization's cybersecurity posture using Microsoft Defender tools.

- **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Incidents Management and Analysis** : This hands-on exercise participants gained practical skills in incident management, threat investigation, and real-time remediation using Microsoft 365 Defender, enhancing their ability to respond to security incidents effectively.
  
## Pre-requisites

- Familiarity with Microsoft 365 Defender and its components.
- Understanding of cybersecurity principles and attack methodologies.
- Access to a Microsoft 365 tenant with appropriate licenses.

## Architecture

The architecture diagram outlines a sequence of labs for implementing and configuring Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Starting with setup and role configuration, users will configure device groups and create baseline policies. Subsequent labs focus on onboarding machines, managing vulnerabilities, configuring endpoint detection and response (EDR), testing endpoint capabilities, and simulating attack scenarios for hands-on security training.

## Explanation of Components

- **Azure Portal** : It is a web-based interface provided by Microsoft for managing and monitoring Azure resources and services. It serves as a central hub for users to create, configure, and manage their Azure resources, applications, and services.

- **Microsoft Defender Portal** : It is a security management platform that integrates various security solutions within the Microsoft ecosystem, enabling organizations to protect their environments across Microsoft 365, Azure, and other platforms. 

- **Microsoft Purview Portal** It is a unified platform designed for data governance, compliance, and risk management within Microsoft 365 and other Microsoft services. It provides organizations with the tools to manage and protect their data assets while ensuring compliance with various regulations.

- **Setup Defender for Endpoint**: Initiating Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, a cloud-powered endpoint security solution that detects, investigates, and responds to advanced threats.

- **Onboard Windows Server Devices**: Adding Windows Server devices to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for centralized monitoring and threat detection.

- **Run a Detection Test**: Performing a simulated threat detection test to validate the Defender for Endpoint configuration and ensure it can effectively identify security threats.

- **Incident and Alerts**: Managing and responding to security incidents and alerts generated by Defender for Endpoint. Incidents are collections of related alerts that signal potential threats.

- **Actions & Live Responses**: Initiating actions such as isolating compromised devices, collecting forensic data, or taking live responses (e.g., real-time analysis and remediation).

- **Configure and Validate the Simulated Drive-by URL Attack**: Setting up a simulated drive-by download attack to assess the response of Defender for Endpoint. This test helps validate that the system can detect and block such web-based attacks effectively.
